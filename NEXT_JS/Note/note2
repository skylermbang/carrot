Learning : page , navigation, client component , layout




Page:  Since this is from NEXT JS Framework We need this 
        How to add new page ? 

        In NEXT js  we use url based.

Rendering 
It is the process of turning React components into HTML that the browser can understand.
it happens different in CSR (brower) or SSR (server)


CSR (Client-Side Rendering):
The browser gets an HTML shell and a JavaScript bundle from the server.
The UI is built using JavaScript in the browser (e.g., Chrome).

[Pros]: Fast page changes after loading, great for web apps

[Cons]: Slower initial load, bad SEO, requires JavaScript

SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
Every time the user requests a page, the server generates the full HTML and sends it to the browser.

[Pros]: Fast initial load, good SEO, great for content-heavy pages

[Cons]: Slower page transitions, more load on the servera


Hydration 

Hydration is when the server-rendered HTML becomes interactive in the browser using React.

/about-us -------> boring HTML ----->  :) ------> init(Boring HTML <hydration>)
